# PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS-OF-CLASSIFIERS-THROUGH-DETECTING-ANXIETY-
This research works conducts a comprehensive investigation into the performance analysis 
of machine learning classifiers in the context of detecting anxiety. The study addresses the 
pressing need for precise and efficient diagnostic tools in mental health. Central to this 
investigation is the identification of discriminative features crucial for successful anxiety 
detection. Uncovering these elements enriches our understanding of the factors 
contributing to accurate predictions and provides insights for refining existing models 
which are Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and 
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The study also assesses the generalizability of classifiers 
across diverse datasets, emphasizing their adaptability to varied real-world scenarios. This 
research significantly contributes to the ongoing discussion of artificial intelligence and 
mental healthâ€™s intersection. The findings not only have theoretical implications but also 
are practical for healthcare professionals interested in comprehensive and effective anxiety 
assessment tools. The study demonstrates the power of machine learning in transforming 
mental health evaluation and serves as a blueprint for further study, development, and 
responsible deployment of innovative technologies aimed at enhancing better well-being.
